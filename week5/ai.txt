LLM model used: ChatGPT 
Version: GPT-5

This ai.txt will be very similar to prior descriptions, as I used it in pretty much the same way.

Prompts and Topics:
Throughout my work on deliverable 3 I used ChatGPT to:
- Used it to genate bash script cell recommnedations for the notebook file for each section.
- Used it help debug and plan how to run each script for each step.
- got its help when setting up IGV and working with the screenshots.

Notes:
- I edited and ran all code locally to verify correctness.
- AI suggestions were adapted and integrated into my own implementation unless a version the ai suggested worked really well the first time.
- Not all outputs from ChatGPT were used directly â€” in some cases I rolled back to earlier versions or of course ignored the answers and solution prototypes that I knew were wrong or would not work.
